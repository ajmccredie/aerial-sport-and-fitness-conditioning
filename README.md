# aerial-sport-and-fitness-conditioning
The completed website can be viewed here: https://ajmccredie.github.io/aerial-sport-and-fitness-conditioning/.
In summary, the site is a source of short conditioning videos targeted for improving aerial sport performance. The website and mobile site are designed to be appealing to users who already use similar fitness apps and sites, but far easier to locate and navigate content than social media sites. <br>
Aerial Sport and Fitness is a real company, and all the videos and images are provided for use in site development (with the exception of the sunset-yoga image used for the 'general conditioning' page video link buttons).

## Site features and navigation
The site is laid out in a traditional manner with a text-based navigation bar at the top of the page. The pages this bar allows access to are 'Why' (reasons why conditioning is important), each discipline's own page ('Pole', 'Hoop', 'Silks' and 'General/Floor/Non-apparatus-specific'), and 'About' (details of the company behind the videos and external links that may be of interest to the user). <br>
Every page contains the site logo (which also works as a 'Home' button), social media links at the base (linked directly to Aerial Sport and Fitness Facebook and Instagram pages) and visual navigational link buttons for each of the disciplines. Each of these repeated links is animated for hover and active, allowing the user to navigate smoothly through the site.

## The User Experience (UX)
### Strategy
#### A first-time user will:
•	Be greeted with professional first impressions of company image, and the feeling that they are in safe hands with the site owner’s instructions. <br>
•	Instantly gain an impression of the breadth of the site through the content of the traditional navigation bar and be able to decide their own preferences for moving through the content.<br>
•	Find inspiration through the slogan on the home page and the reasons on the 'why condition?' page.<br>
•	Smoothly find, select, and access video conditioning content of their choosing.<br>

#### A returning user will:
•	Navigate smoothly through the breadth and depth of conditioning content available, locating not only content they have already identified as useful, but also discovering other content and maybe following some of the navigation suggestions. <br>
•	Confidently use the links at both the top and bottom of the page to access content, depending on whichever is the more convenient at any particular point in time.<br>

#### A frequent user will:
•	Want to return to the site as they find and access more challenging content and attempt the suggested extensions available.<br>
•	Become more engaged with the site as they see the impact of their hard work on their in-person aerial training lessons and routine practises.

#### The site owner will:
•	Provide aerial atheletes at every level with conditioning exercises aimed at improving future performance in their selected discipline(s). The content is progressive, allowing meaningful access for beginners right up through to advanced exercises.<br>
•	See the benefit of the users regularly performing these exercises when they are able to accelerate their physical progress in class or in the routines they choreograph.

### The Scope Plane
From the information based on the strategies for the User Experiences, a variety of aerial discipline conditioning exercises will be available to target a range of muscle groups. The user will have options based on personal preferences and progression.
#### What's on the table for production and what's not (at least for now)?
Single, short videos with written instructions for repetitions will be presented. <br>
No full work-outs at this time (although users will be guided towards suggested suitable exercises to attempt following the one they have just done). Future developments could also include multiple options for some of the classes of exercises and potentially adding music clips behind the videos.

### The Structure Plane
The home page is simple and uncluttered, allowing the user to navigate smoothly to the content available. There are pages giving reasons for the user to be interested in the conditioning content available, and further information on the company providing the information.<br>
The conditioning videos themselves are grouped into four distinct disciplines: pole, hoop, silks and floor (i.e. apparatus free). Within each of these sections (each has its own page), the information is then subdivided by targeted muscle groups (arms, core and legs) and simple general conditioning for the apparatus. Each of these are then further subdivided by suggested difficulty (beginner, intermediate and advanced). <br>
In order to aid navigation, each discipline page then follows the same layout: scrolling in “y” or using the quick navigation links to choose between targeted muscle groups and then scrolling in “x” to choose difficulty.

### The Skeleton Plane
**Homepage layout**: Traditional layout with a company logo in the top left, the navigation bar spanning the screen for larger screens, or list style on smaller screens, a hero image with a navigational slogan, visual navigation buttons and then social media links in the footer.<br>
![image](https://github.com/ajmccredie/aerial-sport-and-fitness-conditioning/assets/127118760/01972be6-2083-4003-8b16-d5c0d2da4fd0)
<br>
**Why condition layout**: The information contained in the boxes is straightforward and motivational, rather than being very detailed and particularly technical or in-depth. This is appropriate for the site users, who would not want, nor expect more detailed information to be displayed here.
![image](https://github.com/ajmccredie/aerial-sport-and-fitness-conditioning/assets/127118760/3a47115a-3e3c-4c72-a62a-467eb3b55731)
<br>
**Discipline layout**: The scrollbars have been omitted, owing to many devices (particularly of the type most likely to be used by people following fitness routines) being touch screen. In larger screens, people without a touch screen can use the links to navigate “y” and all the content in “x” is available on the screen. Smaller viewing screens, such as tablets and phones, should have touch screens to allow access to the difficulty levels of the exercises.

The disciplines use different images behind their buttons, and a consistent layout across the four discipline pages in terms of information organisation.<br>
Pages for each video confirm the type of exercise selected and display a custom video loading poster for the site. There are three boxes under each video of a consistent colour and layout. Rather than providing the user with an obvious ‘back’ button, the familiar links from all the other pages are available. This allows the user to choose whether they follow the advice in the ‘pairs well with’ suggestions, or make their own navigation selections.

### General aesthetic choices and the Surface Plane
The colours which dominate the website reflect the existing logo and a pallette to match this smoothly. Colours were used on backgrounds and checked for readability. <br>
The finished product will have a professional, sleek, and modern look in order to give the users confidence in the content. <br>
A key design element was the orientation of the videos used. These are consistently in portrait because the site owner was able to fit the apparatus into these more effectively. The videos can still be seen clearly on desktop deployment and a mobile phone user would not need to re-orientate their phone to show the content. It is also a better user experience for the user being able to ‘prop’ up their phone in this orientation while the video is playing. <br>
The dark grey is used to offset the company colour of the purple. Inspirational images and the photos used on the video selection navigation elements are in greyscale, although videos play in full colour. The logo and the visual navigation elements are in the company purple colours and not in greyscale. Colours are selected throughout in order to provide sufficient contrast to be readable. <br>
The typography selections were Oswald and Quicksand. These contrast, whilst still providing a professional and modern look to the site. The pairing suitability was suggested by Fontpair (Fontpair, 2023) <br>
Hero images are used on the home page and the “why condition” page in order to inspire the user. I used the image zoom from the walkthrough project because after trying a few other transformations and animations, I preferred the subtlety of the slow zoom and the inherent emphasis on the athleticism of the image. The home page image is not as high a resolution as I would have preferred, however it was the one selected by the site owner. Initially the homepage had no inspirational slogan, but it was agreed with the site owner in the latter stages of development that one would be appropriate. It has the same design features of the purple boxes overlaying the image as used on the “why” page. <br>
Hovering over links provides feedback to the user: The home-page link ‘glows’, the text navigation links increase in size, the visual navigation links lift, gain a shadow and increase in brightness and the video links increase in size and brightness, and gain focus.

<br>
**The “about us”** page only uses a full-colour headshot of the coach (wearing her British Pole Sports Coaching uniform). The company logo is at the top left of the page and “glows” when it is hovered over (to give the user feedback that it is a navigation element). The main text navigation bar has text which enlarges when hovered over and when that page is active: this helps the user to know where they are on the site and how to move around smoothly. Additionally, each training discipline has a stylised visual image button near the base of the page. Each of these provide quick links to the discipline content and all change colour slightly and “lift up” when hovered over.

## Screen size responsiveness
For medium size screens, the text menu moves to be stacked in a list on the left, rather than filling the span of the page. The hero and inspiring  images are made smaller. The visual navigation links wrap to a square rather than a horizontal line. <br> 
It is likely the predominant user will be on a tablet or a phone screen for their workouts, so it was important to carefully consider the layout in these formats.<br>
On smaller screens, the alignment is designed for portrait orientation of features, and where appropriate, these are rearranged into vertical stacks.<br>
![image](https://github.com/ajmccredie/aerial-sport-and-fitness-conditioning/assets/127118760/d0d5a943-7ec4-48c7-ab35-dabb9b1f448d)
<br>
On even smaller screens, boxes used to contain information are restyled to stack, making the content less cluttered for these screens:

For mobile screens, the inspiring text box is moved so as to not obscure the image’s face.

## Testing and Deployment Details
Initial issues and bugs centred around layout issues. This was mostly down to inexperience, but prompted a range of wider reading to troubleshoot the issues encountered. One particular bug was the sizing of the images, for the logo this was fixed with ‘contain’, for the hero image this was mostly fixed with trial and error of margin positions and box size. <br>
The need for the video loading poster was found later-on. Although there was a default spinning circle to show the user the video was loading, it was felt that a polite message, showing the company’s logo, would improve the user experience.  <br>
When testing in the latter stages, the site was made public through a Github feature, and allowed several different phone makes and sizes a chance to access the content. A number of issues regarding size, layout and handling of overflow were found and fixed from this. It was also found the ‘hover’ features used on the desktop site did not translate well to the mobile user (which would also be true for tablet users). A decision was taken on a case-by-case basis whether to leave the feature in place, acknowledging that it wouldn’t affect the user, or whether to change it. The main change was the display of the buttons to access the videos, which were blurred slightly for the desktop version. The mobile version removes the blur to aid the reading of the content. <br>
The CSS code passed through the validator with no issues. The HTML code found a few issues requiring fixing. These were fixed and the final site runs as intended.
