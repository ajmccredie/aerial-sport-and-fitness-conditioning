# aerial-sport-and-fitness-conditioning
- link to live deployed site to be added here -
A source of short conditioning videos targeted for improving aerial sport performance. The website and mobile site are designed to be appealing to users who already use similar fitness apps and sites, but far easier to locate and navigate content than social media sites.
Aerial Sport and Fitness is a real company, and all the videos and images are provided for use in site development (with the exception of the sunset-yoga image used for the 'general conditioning' page video link buttons).
## Site features and navigation
The site is laid out in a traditional manner with a text-based navigation bar at the top of the page. The pages this bar allows access to are 'Why' (reasons why conditioning is important), each discipline's own page ('Pole', 'Hoop', 'Silks' and 'General/Floor/Non-apparatus-specific'), and 'About' (details of the company behind the videos and external links that may be of interest to the user).
Every page contains the site logo (which also works as a 'Home' button), social media links at the base (linked directly to Aerial Sport and Fitness Facebook and Instagram pages) and visual navigational link buttons for each of the disciplines. Each of these repeated links is animated for hover and active, allowing the user to navigate smoothly through the site.
## The User Experience (UX)
### A first time user will:
- (first impressions of company image)
- (instantly gain an impression of the bredth of the site through the content of the traditional navigation bar)
- (be inspired through the slogan on the home page and the reasons on the 'why condition?' page)
- smoothly find and access video conditioning content of their choosing
### A returning user will:
- (navigate smoothly through the bredth and depth of conditioning content available)
- (use the links at both the top and bottom of the page to access content)
- (start to learn how to quickly find their favourite videos, but will also access more content over time)
### A frequent user will:
- (find and access more challenging content and attempt the suggested extensions available)
- (become more engaged with the site as they see the impact of their hard work on their in-person aerial training lessons and routine practise)
## General aesthetic choices
The colours which dominate the website reflect the existing logo and a pallette to match this smoothly. Colours were used on backgrounds and checked for readability.
